# Decoding the Caesar Cipher 🔐

---
#### What is Caesar Cypher ?

→ In the Caesar Cipher method the original letters of plaintext move forward by a specific number of positions through the alphabet sequence.  When the shift value stands at 3 then plaintext 'A' transmutes to 'D' and 'B' advances to 'E' in the ciphertext.  The Caesar Cipher stands as one of the original encryption methods which experts widely recognize in classical cryptography.

- The operation **Caesar Cypher Decryption** starts its encrypted text decryption process.  The Python script functions as a decryption tool for Caesar Ciphed text because it moves letters from plaintext by pre-defined positions in the alphabet sequence.  The script requires validation from users before proceeding to the next key because the users must confirm correct decryption options among 26 test shifts. 🔄

-  Following each shift check the script prompts the user to verify the decryption outcome by displaying the ciphertext. The program shows the decrypted message before finishing after user verification. The program progresses to the next shift if the user does not verify the correct decryption. This utility functions with ciphertext text made of **uppercase** along with **lowercase** letters without decrypting **non-letter characters** such as punctuation or spaces . 🔠✉️

-  The decryption process is assisted through simple "yes/y" or "no/n" responses which the user receives after each shift. The decryption leads to the final display of results that allows users to recuperate their original text from the encrypted content. This script adopts a brute-force method to test all shifts ranging from 0 through 25 for creating decodable ciphertexts for any encryption method . 🛠️🔑

-  The script requires only your encrypted text for entry to begin decoding it. The software program will perform tests on each shift while displaying results individually until the task finishes. The procedure ends on successful decryption discovery and users will be prompted to validate the accuracy of the text after each shift test . ✅

-  The program functions with only a single requirement of running Python software without additional library dependencies. This script allows users to decrypt Caesar Cypher encrypted messages regardless of whether their need stems from **cryptography** studies or secret message decrypting . 🔍


## How to Apply ⚙️  
  
- Download or clone the project to your computer. 💻  
- The script needs to be executed using a Python environment. 🖥  
- The program will prompt you to provide the ciphertext you want to decrypt after which you must enter it. 🔒  
-  The correct decryption shift should be verified through the provided instructions. ✅



## Features ✨

→ Through this Caesar Cypher Decryption script the provided ciphertext undergoes decryption with every possible one of its 26 encryption shifts. To determine which decrypted message is correct the script shows each attempt and requests manual validation from a user. The script maintains the ability to decrypt both uppercase and lowercase letters together with all punctuation marks and non-letter textual characters including spaces. The decryption process checks every possible shift through extensive procedural testing until the correct decryption match is located.
